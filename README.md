my project involves configuring small-scale networks and understanding TCP/IP addressing. In networking, 
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a suite of protocols used for communication over the Internet. 
Here are some key concepts i learned from this project:

IP Addressing:

IPv4: The most common version of IP addresses. It uses a 32-bit address scheme and is expressed in dotted-decimal format (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
IPv6: A newer version of IP addresses with a larger address space (128-bit) to accommodate the growing number of devices on the Internet.
Subnetting:

Subnetting involves dividing a larger network into smaller subnetworks to improve performance and security.
It helps in efficient utilization of IP addresses and reduces network congestion.
Routing:

Routing involves directing data packets between networks. Routers play a crucial role in determining the best path for data to travel.
Network Configuration:

Configuring network devices such as routers, switches, and computers with appropriate IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways.
TCP/IP Protocols:

Understanding key protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
TCP ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data, while UDP provides faster but less reliable communication.
Network Security:

Implementing security measures, such as firewalls and access control lists (ACLs), to protect the network from unauthorized access.
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):

DHCP is used to automatically assign IP addresses to devices on a network, simplifying the process of network configuration.
DNS (Domain Name System):

DNS translates human-readable domain names
